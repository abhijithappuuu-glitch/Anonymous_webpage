3. **Generate an App Password:**

   - Generate a password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

4. **Update backend/.env file:**

   # Uncomment and fill these:
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

```

## Testing Without Email Setup

2. Try to register or login
