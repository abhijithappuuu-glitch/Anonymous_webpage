# üéØ RENDER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - VISUAL GUIDE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

Your backend is deployed but **MongoDB connection is failing** because environment variables are not set!

Error from logs:
```
‚ùå MongoDB connection error: MongoParseError: Invalid scheme, expected connection string to start with "mongodb://" or "mongodb+srv://"
```

This means `MONGODB_URI` is either:
- Not set at all
- Set incorrectly (has typo or missing parts)

---

## üìç Your Backend URL (NEW!)

Your Render service is now at:
```
https://anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com
```

(Note: This changed from `anonymous-club-backend.onrender.com` to `anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com`)

---

## üîß STEP-BY-STEP: Add Environment Variables

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Open: **https://dashboard.render.com/**
2. Sign in with your account
3. You should see your service: **anonymous-club-backend**

### Step 2: Click on Your Service
Look for the service card that shows:
- Name: `anonymous-club-backend`
- Status: üü¢ Live (green dot)
- URL: `https://anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com`

### Step 3: Go to Environment Tab
On the left sidebar, click: **"Environment"**

### Step 4: Add Each Variable

Click the button: **"Add Environment Variable"**

For each variable below, you need to:
1. Enter the **Key** (left box)
2. Enter the **Value** (right box)
3. Click **"Add"** or continue to next variable

---

## üìã COPY-PASTE THESE VARIABLES

### Variable 1: MONGODB_URI
```
Key:
MONGODB_URI

Value:
mongodb+srv://anonymoussdmcet_db_user:0Bpf2PiwefdgHyV2@anonymouscluster.5kizb.mongodb.net/anonymoussdmcet_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=AnonymousCluster
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Copy the entire connection string above. Don't add quotes, don't modify it!

---

### Variable 2: JWT_SECRET
```
Key:
JWT_SECRET

Value:
your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-2024
```

---

### Variable 3: EMAIL_SERVICE
```
Key:
EMAIL_SERVICE

Value:
gmail
```

```
Key:
EMAIL_USER

Value:
anonymous.sdmcet@gmail.com
```

---

### Variable 5: EMAIL_PASS
```
Key:
EMAIL_PASS

Value:

```

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a Gmail App Password**, not the regular Gmail password!

---

### Variable 6: NODE_ENV

### Variable 8: PORT
```

PORT

Value:
10000
```

---

## üíæ Step 5: Save Changes

After adding all 8 variables:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page
2. Click the blue button: **"Save Changes"**

Render will show: **"Deploying..."**

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Step 6: Wait for Redeployment

This takes about **2-3 minutes**. You'll see:

1. **"Deploying..."** (yellow) - Building your app
2. **"Live"** (green) - Successfully deployed!

---

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Check Logs

After deployment completes:
1. Click **"Logs"** on the left sidebar
2. Look for these success messages:

```
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
üöÄ Server running on port 10000
```

If you see these, **SUCCESS!** Your backend is working!

---

## ‚ùå If You Still See Errors

### Error: "Invalid scheme"
**Problem**: MONGODB_URI was not copied correctly

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE connection string
- No extra spaces at beginning or end
- No quotes around the value
- Starts with: `mongodb+srv://`
- Ends with: `appName=AnonymousCluster`

### Error: "Authentication failed"
**Problem**: Wrong MongoDB credentials

**Solution**: 
- Double-check the connection string
- Make sure username is: `anonymoussdmcet_db_user`
- Make sure password is: `0Bpf2PiwefdgHyV2`

### Error: "Email service not configured"
**Problem**: EMAIL_SERVICE, EMAIL_USER, or EMAIL_PASS missing

**Solution**: 
- Verify all 3 email variables are set
- EMAIL_SERVICE = `gmail` (lowercase)
- EMAIL_PASS should be the app password: `mgha cjmu jbpl ezrr`

---

## üß™ Test Your Backend

After successful deployment, test these URLs:

### Health Check
```
https://anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}`

### Login Test
```
https://anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com/api/auth/login
```
POST with body:
```json
{
  "email": "anonymous.sdmcet@gmail.com",
  "password": "SecureAdmin2024!"
}
```

---

## üì± Update Frontend

I've already updated your frontend `.env` files to use the new URL:
```
https://anonymous-club-backend-f2ai.onrender.com
```

After you add the environment variables and backend redeploys, commit and push to trigger Vercel redeploy:

```powershell
cd "d:\anon web"
git add .
git commit -m "Update backend URL to new Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

## üéØ Quick Checklist

Before testing, verify you have:

- [ ] Opened Render Dashboard
- [ ] Found anonymous-club-backend service
- [ ] Clicked "Environment" tab
- [ ] Added MONGODB_URI (the long connection string)
- [ ] Added JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Added EMAIL_SERVICE = gmail
- [ ] Added EMAIL_USER = anonymous.sdmcet@gmail.com
- [ ] Added EMAIL_PASS = mgha cjmu jbpl ezrr
- [ ] Added NODE_ENV = production
- [ ] Added FRONTEND_URL = https://anonymoussdmcet.vercel.app
- [ ] Added PORT = 10000
- [ ] Clicked "Save Changes"
- [ ] Waited for "Live" status (2-3 min)
- [ ] Checked logs for "‚úÖ MongoDB connected"

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If backend still shows MongoDB errors after adding variables:

1. **Screenshot the Render logs** (after "Save Changes" redeploy)
2. **Screenshot your Environment variables page** (hide sensitive values)
3. **Check if MONGODB_URI shows the full connection string** (should be very long, ~200 characters)

Common mistakes:
- ‚ùå Adding quotes around values (don't do this!)
- ‚ùå Extra spaces before/after values
- ‚ùå Typos in variable names (must match exactly)
- ‚ùå Wrong connection string format

**The #1 most important variable is MONGODB_URI - make sure it's set correctly!** üéØ
