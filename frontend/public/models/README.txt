Place your 3D logo model file here with the exact name:

Anonymous.glb

Notes:
- File path used in code: /models/Anonymous.glb
- Keep file size as small as possible (<5-10MB ideal) for web.
- Use KHR_draco_mesh_compression if available to reduce size.
- Ensure model has proper orientation; if it's rotated, adjust in ThreeLogo: rotation prop.
- On Vercel/production, files in /public are served statically.
